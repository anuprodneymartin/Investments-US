A programme created using CRUD systems inspired by stock broking firms.

Developed this website on a CRUD system with 3 models using on to one and one to many associations.
Users can login to create stock portfolio's and monitor the prices of those stocks which are inhouse researched and for the timebeing the users can add 9 stocks that I have researched on; to their portfolio. Each user can create a single portfolio for him/herself with an email address and a password that is been encrypted with Bcrypt security system. Moreover once the user/s have signedup and ready to use our website they can read about the stocks that have been researched and know a few things about great investors and their investment philosophy behind their success in stock selection and investing.
